# Self-assembling Carbon nano tubes via Teslacoil

<article style=""><h1>Tesla Coil Remotely Induces Nanotubes to Self Assemble</h1><p>Nikola Tesla conjured up all sorts of interesting experiments for his famed "Tesla Coils." Today, however, their main use has been relegated largely to impressing visitors at science museums. That is about to change. Researchers at Rice University have used Tesla coils to get carbon nanotubes to self-assemble into long chains, a phenomenon the scientists have dubbed "Teslaphoresis."</p><img src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjc0Mjk1Ng" /></article>
